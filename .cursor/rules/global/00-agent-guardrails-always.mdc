# Agent Guardrails

- Detect stack by reading: package.json, vite.config.*, tailwind.config.*
- Exclude Nuxt; do not propose Nuxt solutions.
- Prefer plan → confirm → patch-sized diffs (no whole-file dumps).
- Ask before touching >10 files; batch large refactors by folder.
- Never print secrets or .env contents; never edit node_modules or generated files.
- Keep answers concise; cite exact lines/regions to modify.
