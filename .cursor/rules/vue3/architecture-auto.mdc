# Architecture (Composition + <script setup>)

- Use <script setup> with typed defineProps/defineEmits.
- Split logic into composables under src/composables/*.
- Prefer presentational + container components for complexity.
- Tailwind for spacing/layout/typography; avoid inline styles.
- File names: PascalCase.vue; one component per file.
