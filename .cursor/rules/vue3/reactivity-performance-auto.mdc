# Reactivity & Performance

- Prefer computed over watchers for derivable values.
- Use shallowRef for large non-reactive payloads.
- Keep lists keyed and stable; avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Cleanup side effects in onUnmounted; debounce expensive effects.
- Code-split routes and heavy widgets (Vite dynamic imports).
