# Composables

- Files should be named with the `use` prefix (e.g., `useBoolean` in `boolean.ts`).
- Keep composables focused on a single concern and return only the reactive pieces that consumers need.
- Re-export all composables from `src/composables/index.ts` for easy imports.
- Prefer Composition API utilities and TypeScript for strong typing.
