# DO NOT SUGGEST RUNNING DEV COMMANDS

**CRITICAL RULE: ALWAYS ENFORCED**

The development server is **ALREADY RUNNING** at http://localhost:3001/ (or 3000) (PNPM-based). 

## Absolute Prohibition

**NEVER** suggest, recommend, or mention running any of these commands:
- `pnpm dev`
- `pnpm run dev` 
- `npm run dev`
- `npm start`
- `yarn dev`
- `yarn start`
- Any variation of starting/restarting the development server

## This Rule ALWAYS Applies When:
- Making code changes to existing files
- Creating new components
- Modifying Vue components, services, or utilities
- Any file modification within the running development environment
- User is working within an active development session

## Rationale
- The project uses **PNPM** (not npm)
- Development server is **already running** on http://localhost:3001/
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) automatically applies changes
- Suggesting dev commands after every task is **disruptive** and **unnecessary**
- Creates noise and breaks the development flow

## Enforcement - What to Say Instead

### ✅ ALWAYS Acceptable:
- "Your changes are now live at http://localhost:3001/"
- "The changes will be reflected automatically in your browser"  
- "You can preview the updated functionality at http://localhost:3001/"
- "Since HMR is active, your changes should appear immediately"
- Simply complete the task without mentioning server commands

### ❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:
- "Now run `pnpm dev`"
- "Start the development server with `pnpm dev`"
- "Open terminal and run the dev server"
- "Let's start the server"
- "Run `npm run dev`" (wrong package manager anyway)
- Any suggestion to start/restart/run development commands

## ONLY Exceptions (Very Rare):
- New environment variables added to `.env`
- Vite configuration changes in `vite.config.ts`
- Package.json scripts modified
- Build tool configuration changes
- Explicit HMR failure requiring full restart

## Reminder
- This is a **PERMANENT** rule
- The server is **ALWAYS** assumed to be running during development
- Focus on completing tasks, not on server management
- Respect the user's workflow and don't interrupt with unnecessary commands
