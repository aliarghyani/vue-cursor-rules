# Environment Variables

Use `env.example` as the template for required variables. Prefix variables that should be exposed to the client with `VITE_`.
```
# This file load the variables only in development mode.
# If you're going to expose an env to the app (e.g. vue files), the env name must be prefixed with 'VITE_'.
# Example: VITE_APP_TITLE: hello world
# Also to prevent the secrets leakage, use a `.env.development.local` file and put the secrets on there.
```
Expected variables include `VITE_API_URL`, `VITE_FILE_URL`, and `VITE_WEBSITE_URL` among others.
