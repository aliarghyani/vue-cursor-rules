# Types

- Use `.d.ts` files to declare application interfaces and types.
- Prefer `interface` for object shapes and `type` aliases for unions or primitives.
- Avoid default exports in type files; use named exports.
- Organize domain-specific types into their own files and re-export from `src/types/index.ts` when needed.
