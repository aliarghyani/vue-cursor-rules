## Frequently Asked Questions

This section addresses common inquiries about using Vue 3 Cursor Rules across different contexts and requirements.

### Getting Started Guidance

Basic Vue 3 knowledge is recommended but not strictly required, as the rules teach best practices during development. The rules are specifically designed for Vue 3 with Composition API and are not compatible with Vue 2 projects.

TypeScript is highly recommended but not mandatory. While the rules provide maximum value with TypeScript, they can be used with JavaScript projects. For Nuxt users, separate conventions apply as these rules focus on standard Vue 3 development without framework-specific abstractions.

**Section sources**
- [FAQ.md](file://docs/FAQ.md#L15-L50)

### Technical Implementation Questions

The rules require Cursor IDE to function properly and will not work in other editors like VS Code. They must be placed in the `.cursor/rules/` directory at the project root to be recognized by the IDE.

Specific rules can be disabled by removing or renaming rule files. Custom rules can be added by creating new `.md` or `.mdc` files in the rules directory following the established format. The rules are compatible with major Vue 3 UI frameworks including Vuetify, Element Plus, Quasar, and Tailwind CSS.

**Section sources**
- [FAQ.md](file://docs/FAQ.md#L55-L90)

### Usage and Best Practice Considerations

The rules are optimized for production applications requiring maintainability, accessibility, and performance. They may be too comprehensive for quick prototypes or learning projects.

Both junior and senior developers benefit from the rules. Juniors learn proper patterns from the start, while seniors save time on routine coding tasks, ensure team consistency, stay updated with latest patterns, and focus on architecture rather than boilerplate.

### Performance and Cost Management

Contrary to increasing costs, the rules include budget-conscious patterns designed to minimize token usage. Features like "micro-changes only" and "intelligent batching" actually help reduce Cursor API costs.

Budget Mode optimizes development by making smaller targeted changes, reusing existing patterns, avoiding unnecessary refactoring, and batching related changes together. Token usage can be monitored using the `npm run measure:tokens` command.

## Configuration Options

The behavior of Vue 3 Cursor Rules can be customized through package.json scripts and configuration settings.

### Available Scripts

The following npm scripts are available for managing and validating the rules:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `lint:rules` | Validates rule syntax and structure |
| `measure:tokens` | Analyzes token usage patterns |
| `validate` | Runs both linting and token measurement |
| `test:sample` | Executes sample application tests |
| `build:docs` | Generates documentation from rule files |
| `dev:sample` | Starts development server for sample app |
| `setup:sample` | Sets up minimal Vue application for testing |
| `release` | Prepares patch version release |
| `release:minor` | Prepares minor version release |
| `release:major` | Prepares major version release |

**Section sources**

### Customization Settings

The rules support configuration through a JSON object that controls various aspects of their behavior:

```json
{
  "budget_mode": true,
  "typescript_strict": true,
  "accessibility_level": "AA",
  "ui_framework": "auto-detect",
  "performance_monitoring": true,
  "security_patterns": true
}
```

These settings allow teams to adjust the strictness of TypeScript usage, accessibility compliance level, preferred UI framework, and whether to include performance and security patterns.

## UI Framework Integration

The rules support integration with multiple UI frameworks while providing guidance on optimal usage patterns.

### Multi-Framework Support Strategy

The rules officially support several major Vue 3 UI frameworks:
- Vuetify (Material Design patterns)
- Ant Design Vue (enterprise components)
- Element Plus (desktop-focused patterns)
- Naive UI (TypeScript-native patterns)
- PrimeVue (rich component ecosystem)
- Quasar (cross-platform patterns)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)

Framework detection occurs automatically through package.json scanning, import analysis, and configuration detection, enabling smart, framework-specific suggestions.

- [FAQ.md](file://docs/FAQ.md#L155-L165)

### Mixing UI Frameworks and Utility Libraries

When combining utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind with component libraries, follow these guidelines:

- Use UI kit components for complex interactive controls (forms, modals, data tables)
- Use Tailwind utilities for layout, spacing, typography, and simple styling
- Avoid deep CSS overrides of UI kit components; prefer official theming APIs
- Maintain consistent design language across the application

Specific implementation details and kit-specific rules are documented in the `.cursor/rules/ui-kits/*` directory.
