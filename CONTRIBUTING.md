# Contributing

- Keep each `.mdc` < ~80 lines. Prefer multiple small rules over one large file.
- Use precise globs and "when to apply" notes to avoid loading irrelevant rules.
- Avoid verbose prose; prefer imperative bullets and concrete constraints.
- Test new rules against `samples/minimal-vue-app` before PRs.
