# Vue 3 Cursor Rules (Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind)

Production-minded **Cursor Rules** focused on **Vue 3** (Nuxt excluded). Includes adapters for common Vue UI kits and libs:

- UI kits: Vuetify, Ant Design Vue, Element Plus, Naive UI, PrimeVue, Quasar
- Libs: Pinia, Vue Router 4, Vue I18n 9+, axios, vue3-datepicker

## Quick start (Cursor)

1. Copy `.cursor/rules` into your project.
2. Open Cursor and start coding; rules auto-apply based on file globs and detected deps.

## Money-smart usage

- "Budget Mode" is always available: plan → confirm → small diffs; no full-file dumps; batch refactors.

## Repo layout

- `.cursor/rules/*` — small, focused `.mdc` files by concern
- `docs/*` — how-tos & cost playbook
- `scripts/*` — token/size checks to keep rules lean
- `samples/minimal-vue-app` — a tiny playground you can init with Vite later

> Nuxt intentionally excluded.
