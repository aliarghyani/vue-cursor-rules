# 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions

Get answers to the most common questions about Vue 3 Cursor Rules.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Q: Do I need to know Vue 3 to use these rules?
**A:** Basic Vue 3 knowledge is recommended, but the rules are designed to teach you best practices as you code. If you're new to Vue 3, start with the [official Vue 3 guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/) and then use these rules to accelerate your learning.

### Q: Can I use this with Vue 2 projects?
**A:** No, these rules are specifically designed for Vue 3 with Composition API. Vue 2 has different patterns and best practices that these rules don't cover.

### Q: Do I need TypeScript?
**A:** While not required, TypeScript is highly recommended. The rules provide the most value when used with TypeScript, offering better type safety and development experience.

### Q: What if I'm using Nuxt?
**A:** These rules are intentionally focused on Vue 3 without Nuxt. Nuxt has its own conventions and patterns that differ from standard Vue 3 development.

## 🛠️ Technical Questions

### Q: Why aren't the rules working in my IDE?
**A:** Make sure you're using Cursor IDE (not VS Code or other editors). The rules are specifically designed for Cursor's AI features. Also check that the `.cursor/rules/` directory is in your project root.

### Q: Can I disable specific rules?
**A:** Yes! Simply delete or rename the rule files you don't want. For example, if you don't want accessibility rules, remove the `accessibility/` directory from `.cursor/rules/`.

### Q: How do I add my own custom rules?
**A:** Create new `.md` or `.mdc` files in the `.cursor/rules/` directory. Follow the existing format and patterns. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

### Q: Are the rules compatible with my UI framework?
**A:** Yes! The rules support major Vue 3 UI frameworks:
- ✅ Vuetify
- ✅ Ant Design Vue
- ✅ Element Plus
- ✅ Naive UI
- ✅ PrimeVue
- ✅ Quasar
- ✅ Tailwind CSS

### Q: Do the rules work with Vite/Webpack/other build tools?
**A:** Yes, the rules are build-tool agnostic. They focus on Vue 3 code patterns rather than build configuration.

## 🎯 Usage & Best Practices

### Q: Should I use these rules for every Vue 3 project?
**A:** These rules are optimized for production applications that need maintainability, accessibility, and performance. For quick prototypes or learning projects, they might be too comprehensive.

### Q: How do I know if the rules are helping?
**A:** You'll notice:
- Faster component creation
- More consistent code patterns
- Better error handling
- Improved accessibility
- Fewer bugs and performance issues

### Q: Can junior developers use these rules?
**A:** Absolutely! The rules are designed to teach best practices. Junior developers often benefit the most as they learn proper patterns from the start.

### Q: What about senior developers?
**A:** Senior developers use these rules to:
- Speed up routine coding tasks
- Ensure consistency across teams
- Stay updated with latest Vue 3 patterns
- Focus on architecture rather than boilerplate

## 🔧 Customization

### Q: Can I modify the rules for my team?
**A:** Yes! Fork the repository and customize the rules for your team's specific needs. The rules are designed to be modified.

### Q: How do I keep my custom rules updated?
**A:** We recommend:
1. Fork the repository
2. Make your customizations in a separate branch
3. Periodically merge updates from the main repository
4. Test thoroughly before deploying to your team

### Q: Can I contribute my improvements back?
**A:** We'd love that! Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and submit a pull request with your improvements.

## 💰 Performance & Cost

### Q: Do these rules increase Cursor API costs?
**A:** The rules include budget-conscious patterns designed to minimize token usage. Features like "micro-changes only" and "intelligent batching" actually help reduce costs.

### Q: What is "Budget Mode"?
**A:** Budget Mode optimizes for cost-effective AI development by:
- Making smaller, targeted changes
- Reusing existing patterns
- Avoiding unnecessary refactoring
- Batching related changes together

### Q: How do I monitor token usage?
**A:** Run `npm run measure:tokens` to analyze your token usage patterns and optimize further.

## 🎨 Framework-Specific Questions

### Q: I'm using Vuetify. Do I need special setup?
**A:** No special setup needed! The rules automatically detect Vuetify and provide relevant patterns. Just make sure Vuetify is installed in your project.

### Q: What about Tailwind CSS integration?
**A:** Tailwind CSS is fully supported. The rules will suggest Tailwind classes and responsive design patterns when Tailwind is detected.

### Q: Can I mix multiple UI frameworks?
**A:** While technically possible, it's not recommended. Stick to one primary UI framework for consistency. See [UI_KITS_MIXING.md](UI_KITS_MIXING.md) for details.

## 🔐 Security & Accessibility

### Q: Do the rules help with security?
**A:** Yes! The rules include patterns for:
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
- Secure authentication
- Input validation
- Safe data handling

### Q: What accessibility level do the rules target?
**A:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is the default target. The rules suggest:
- Semantic HTML
- ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Color contrast compliance

### Q: Can I adjust the accessibility level?
**A:** Yes, you can modify or remove accessibility rules based on your project's requirements.

## 🧪 Testing

### Q: Do the rules help with testing?
**A:** Yes! The rules include patterns for:
- Unit testing with Vue Test Utils
- Component testing
- Integration testing
- E2E testing
- Accessibility testing

### Q: What testing frameworks are supported?
**A:** The rules work with popular testing frameworks:
- Vitest (recommended)
- Jest
- Cypress
- Playwright
- Testing Library

## 📱 Project Types

### Q: Are these rules good for mobile apps?
**A:** If you're building mobile apps with Vue 3 (using Capacitor, for example), many patterns apply. The responsive design and performance optimization rules are especially valuable.

### Q: What about desktop applications?
**A:** For Electron apps with Vue 3, most rules apply. The performance and state management patterns are particularly useful.

### Q: Can I use this for component libraries?
**A:** Yes! The component architecture and TypeScript patterns are excellent for building reusable component libraries.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Q: The rules seem too strict. Can I relax them?
**A:** Yes! You can:
1. Remove strict TypeScript rules
2. Disable accessibility rules if not needed
3. Remove performance optimization rules for prototypes
4. Customize error handling patterns

### Q: I'm getting too many suggestions. How do I reduce them?
**A:** Try:
1. Enable Budget Mode
2. Remove unused rule files
3. Use more specific file globs in rules
4. Adjust Cursor's suggestion frequency

### Q: The rules conflict with my existing code style.
**A:** You can:
1. Gradually adopt the rules on new code
2. Customize rules to match your style
3. Use the rules as a learning tool rather than strict enforcement
