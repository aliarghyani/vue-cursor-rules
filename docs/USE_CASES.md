# 🧰 Vue 3 Cursor Rules — Real‑World Use Cases

See how the rulepack helps different teams and scenarios with modern, practical Vue 3 patterns.

## 🏢 Enterprise Development

### Large‑Scale Applications
**Challenge:** Consistency across multiple teams and many components.

**How the rules help:**
- Standardized component/composable/store patterns
- Clear typing and reactivity guardrails
- Predictable testing approaches
- Performance‑aware defaults

**Example:** Consistent component structure with typed emits and error boundaries.

## 🏥 Regulated Domains (Gov/Healthcare)

**Challenge:** Strong accessibility and secure‑by‑default practices.

**How the rules help:**
- Encourage semantic HTML, ARIA, and keyboard navigation
- Safer data handling patterns and minimal error leaks
- Predictable folder and feature structure for audits

> Note: The rules promote good practices; they do not guarantee compliance.

## 🧪 Consulting & Agencies

### Rapid Delivery
**Challenge:** Deliver reliable apps quickly for multiple clients.

**How the rules help:**
- Ready patterns for forms, API integration, and state management
- UI‑agnostic core with optional adapters for client‑chosen kits
- Faster onboarding and review via shared conventions

## 🧩 Custom Solutions

**Challenge:** Unique domain logic with maintainable quality.

**How the rules help:**
- Composables with explicit return types and stable signatures
- Typed stores and router meta patterns
- Minimal, copy‑ready examples for common flows

## 🧱 Open Source Projects

### Component Libraries
**Challenge:** Reusable, accessible, performant components.

**How the rules help:**
- Typed props/emits and slot patterns
- Adapter notes for downstream consumers using common UI kits
- Testing guidance for components/composables

## 🎓 Education & Onboarding

**Challenge:** Teaching modern Vue 3 patterns efficiently.

**How the rules help:**
- Clear, copy‑pasteable examples
- Emphasis on Composition API + TypeScript
- Guardrails that reduce common beginner mistakes

These examples are illustrative. Adapt the patterns to your stack, keep the core UI‑agnostic, and apply adapter snippets only when a specific UI kit is in use.
